This plugin allows players to add colors to their item names by using Minecraft's color codes.

When renaming an item, you can type an ampersand (&) followed by a number from 0-9 or a letter from A-F to stylize your item name.

For example, you could type in '&aLucky Pickaxe' into the text field and the resulting name would be <span style="color: green;">'Lucky Pickaxe'</span> in a green color. You can find a complete list of color codes here: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/. Just replace the section symbol 'ยง' with an ampersand '&' when copying and pasting.

Alternatively, to use a hex color code, begin the color with `&x` instead of a hashtag, and before each digit add an ampersand (&). Example: The color `#00aaff` would be written as `&x&0&0&a&a&f&f`.
